# The Valley

## How to play
Just after the game is loaded, it will ask if you want to create a new character or load an old one. If you choose to create a new character, you can name it and select one of 5 classes:
1. Wizard
2. Thinker
3. Barbarian
4. Warrior
5. Cleric

After that the game will start and you can move freely inside the map by using the number keys 1-9, each corrisponding to a specific direction:

    1   2   3
      \ | /
    4 - 5 - 6
      / | \
    7   8   9

Combat is performed using the `H`, `B` and `L` keys to attempt to strike, respectively, the *head*, *body* or *legs* of your opponent. You can also press `S` to cast a magic spell: hit keys `1-3` to choose the spell (*Sleep*, *Psi Lance* and *Crispit*). *Sleep* is available to you from the start; the others as you gain experience. Some monsters are ethereal and **can only be fought with magic**.

The goal of the game is the recovery of the *Helm*, but you must also seek out the *Amulet of Alarian*. This is hidden in one of the *Temples of Y’Nagioth*, which lie on islands in the Valley’s swamps. Six *Amulet Stones* lie within the *Dark Tower*, when found and added to the Amulet they will give you the power of to survive death. Unlike the Lairs and Temples, the Dark Tower has multiple levels: look for the stairs that will take you up or down. You will also find treasure as you explore; this boosts your experience too.

You can save your game by entering one of the Safe Castles at either end of the Valley itself. Between them is a path on which no monster dares tread — you will be safe from threat there.
